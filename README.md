# TouchBall
This project is my personal project.
Touchball is a simple game. A game where you touch and remove circles on the screen a few times.
There are various levels of difficulty, and there is a max quantity for each level of difficulty. 
When the count is reached, the game is terminated.

Remove the circles as soon as possible and hold for as long as possible!
